## Overview

### The challenge

- An interactive stopwatch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Animate and toggle the Play/Pause button depending on its state
- Animate the second hand ball and pause its animation depending on the Play/Pause state
- Reset the time and the second hand ball when clicking the Reset button

### Stage üèó

I wanted to code a very minimalist stopwatch in design and functionality, so this repository is finished at the moment. In a future (when I have more skills) I'll come back to minimize the code.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS with Neumorphism
- Flexbox
- Animations
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I refreshed my CSS, and JavaScript skills and experimented with the Neumorphism.

This practice has helped me to have a better understanding of nested conditionals, advanced Dom Scripting and animations.
